Learning The Mean Stack Course

# Node js
 Node is single Threaded appplicaion
 Asyncronos - Not occuring at the same time. Complete first application and start other
 Designed to address IO scalability not computational Scalability
 Asyncronos methods- prevent the main single thread beein blocked by IO operation like Interrecting with Databases and reading File . When these methods run they are call callBacks
 Can use Child Process To fork into multiple proces.

# Set Tiemout
  This function allows us to run the co de asynchronously- not interrupting the running Process.
  Does not inturrept the running code.

# Computational Blocker
  A heavy Process can Block the main running of the app- To avoid this we can create a child proess.

# Create a Child Process    
  Creating a Child Process seperates the heavy function for rest of the application- and does not affect the flow of the application  

#NPM



# Adding Express

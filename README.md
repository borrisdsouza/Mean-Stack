# Node js
 Node is single Threaded appplicaion
 Asyncronos - Not occuring at the same time. Complete first application and start other
 Designed to address IO scalability not computational Scalability

# Set Tiemout
  This function allows us to run the code asynchronously- not interrupting the running Process.
  Does not inturrept the running code.

#Name Call Back


# Computational Blocker
    A heavy Process can Block the main running of the app- To avoid this we can create a child proess.

# Create a Child Process    
  Creating a Child Process seperates the heavy function for rest of the application- and does not affect the flow of the application
